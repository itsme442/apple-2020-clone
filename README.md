Hey! I wanted to share something exciting with you. I just completed my very first project since I started learning web development! ðŸŽ‰ I cloned the Apple homepage from 2020 using HTML and CSS. 

Itâ€™s a static version, so it doesnâ€™t have any responsive features yet, but Iâ€™m really proud of how it turned out. It was a great learning experience, and I got to practice a lot of the skills Iâ€™ve been working on. 

If youâ€™re interested, Iâ€™d love for you to check it out and hear your thoughts!



Feel free to tweak it further if youâ€™d like!
